# OpenGLv2Scene
An assignment for an openGL computer graphics course written using openGLv2 and C++

This was a 3D graphics assignment requiring us to create a 3D openGLv2 scene using the fixed function pipeline. The scene required
that we create a castle filled with alien invaders and their space craft. My scene consists of a castle and UFO of a classic
saucer shape with a rotating set of spotlights, this can lift off and land. Additionally there are four robots with obvious 
likeness that guard the castle and observe a nearby cannon, which in turn can be fired and rotated. Finally there is various
foliage around the castle. There is further more detailed description in a PDF file I have added to the respository.
